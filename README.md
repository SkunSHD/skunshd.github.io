In this repo I will help a junior javascript developer @SkunSHD to rewrite his code example using frontend best practices.

Done:
1. Implement single global variable pattern
2.

Todo:
1. Implement MVC
2. Use templates (e.g. underscore)
3. Support ES6 + task automation with gulp
4. Tests (jasmine)
5. Use css preprocessors (SCSS)

Description by @SkunSHD
Test task.
Demo: http://skunshd.github.io/

This work supports:
- Add, edit, delete events
- Move by months
- Change the calendar view (selection date \ month \ year)
- Events search
- Events calendar stored in localStorage
- Made without use of external JS/CSS-libraries.
