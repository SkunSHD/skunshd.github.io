In this repo I will help a junior javascript developer @SkunSHD to rewrite his code example using frontend best practices.

Done:
1. IIFE
2. Implement single global variable pattern
3. Move initialization into app.js


Todo:
1. Implement MVC
2. Use templates (e.g. underscore)
3. Support ES6 + task automation with gulp
4. add jsLint
5. Tests (jasmine)
6. Use css preprocessors (SCSS)
7. Create production version
